Hi there, I'm Om Lukhi 👋 an Electronics Engineer
Welcome to my git account !!

I’m an engineer passionate about building systems from the ground up—whether it involves designing precise signal-generation circuits, researching display-driver behavior, or developing complete industrial SDKs for audio transport. My work combines embedded firmware, low-level driver development, digital audio protocols, and hardware–software integration, with a focus on creating reliable and efficient real-time systems.

My engineering journey started with hands-on academic projects that strengthened my foundation in signal processing and embedded design. I designed a digital frequency meter using microcontroller timers and interrupt-driven event counting, focusing on stable measurement, accurate edge detection, and real-time processing. I also built a sine wave generator capable of producing clean, low-distortion analog and digital waveforms with configurable frequency output. These early projects shaped my technical curiosity and introduced me to practical system design.

As a Research Intern, I worked on the implementation of a TFT display driver, where I dealt with timing sequences, driver signal tuning, pixel data flow, and hardware validation. This experience helped me understand low-level driver timing, protocol control, and the intricacies of pixel-pipeline behavior in display hardware.

In the industrial space, my work has revolved around the XCVR module and the development of full audio-transport systems using SPDIF interfaces. I designed and implemented the XCVR driver from scratch, managing register-level configuration, initialization sequences, interface control, and real-time data handling. Alongside the driver, I developed an application capable of encoding raw PCM audio into IEC 60958 (SPDIF) frames and decoding these frames back into raw PCM. This required deep familiarity with digital audio standards, subframe formatting, channel-status structure, and timing-critical signal alignment.

One of my most significant engineering contributions is the development of a complete SDK that integrates the XCVR driver, the raw-PCM/IEC60958 application, and a set of APIs and testing tools. This SDK enables reliable transmission of IEC 60958 frames from the i.MX8MP-AB2 platform to the i.MX8MM-AB2 platform through an SPDIF line using the XCVR module. I built this system entirely from scratch, spanning hardware bring-up, firmware, driver logic, application layer development, and validation.

Today, my focus is on embedded C/C++, board bring-up, digital audio interfaces, low-level debugging, and real-time hardware-software integration. I enjoy taking complex hardware requirements and turning them into clean, maintainable, and reliable embedded systems.
