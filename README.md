ILI9341 TFT Display Driver – STM32

This project contains a basic driver for the ILI9341 TFT LCD Display using an STM32 microcontroller. The display is controlled via SPI communication, and the driver handles proper initialization along with the commands required to operate the screen.

The code supports setting display orientation, writing pixels, drawing simple shapes, and printing text on the LCD. It was tested on an STM32 development board and successfully shows colors, patterns, and characters on the screen.

This work was completed during a Summer 2023 internship to learn embedded display interfacing and graphics programming. The project structure is kept simple and easy to modify for further development and experiments.
